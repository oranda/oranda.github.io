title: Scala on the Rise in Germany
---
[Kevin Shale](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-shale-652a0060/?locale=en_US) was nice enough to invite me to a Scala meetup in Cologne on May 27. I had previously been to the Scala meeting in Berlin, but this was my first time with the [Scala User Group in Cologne](https://www.xing.com/communities/groups/scala-user-group-koeln-bonn-1035441). The talk covered [scalaz](https://typelevel.org/projects/scalaz/), the functional Scala library from Tony Morris. The discussion afterwards was broader and also interesting.

I understand previous meetings were pretty small, but twice the number of people came this time. After taking London and Silicon Valley by storm, it's amazing how fast Scala is catching on in Germany too. I have already had recruiters from Munich and Berlin asking me about it.
